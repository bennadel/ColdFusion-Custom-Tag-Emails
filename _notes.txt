From Cait Mass:
===============
Hi Ben! Good morning! Thanks for reaching out - The top email clients I would focus on would be the following:

* Gmail (Desktop, Gmail App for Mobile, Web )
* Apple Mail (regular + Dark mode on Desktop, iPhone 8 and above for Mobile and iPad retina + Pro)
* Outlook 2013, 2016 and 2019 (Desktop, Mobile, Web)
* Windows 10 (Desktop)
===============



* Core mobile breakpoint of 650px in theme
* Stick to one mobile breakpoint for now.



* Set breakpoint that other elements can check.

* MSO | IE uses tables, others using inline-block with width/max-width %.

* Responsive content class hook? 

* Where does theming live?

* Ability to define "unique" ResponsiveStyles block (only injects once)?

* Sections / Columns like MJML

* aria-hidden="true" on spacer elements.
	- Elements might should probably be TDs with "height" and "Style" for the best support.

* bgcolor on td is the safest way to create background colors.

* Use font-size / color / etc for IMG tags to style ALT text.

* SEt "font-size: 0" on ghost-table wrapper so that the inline-block elements don't have gaps.

* font-size:1rem; font-size:max(1rem, 16px) ... on responsive content???
