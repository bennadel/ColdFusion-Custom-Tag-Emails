# Email DSL Using ColdFusion Custom Tags

This is a proof-of-concept in using ColdFusion custom tags to create a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for generating email content. I've worked on a lot of emails in my life; and, they are very challenging, usually using a complex set of build-tools that inline CSS. I wanted to try something else - something less "magical" - that would be more brute-force and _more predictable_.
